# ✅ TRASH/SOFT DELETE IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## 🎉 SUCCESS SUMMARY

All trash functionality has been successfully implemented and tested! The complete soft delete workflow is now fully functional.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1. **Soft Delete (Move to Trash)**

- **UI**: Delete button in regular views performs soft delete
- **Backend**: PUT `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}` with `{metadata: {deleted: true}}`
- **Effect**: Note is hidden from regular views and appears in trash

### 2. **Trash View**

- **UI**: Trash view shows only deleted notes
- **Backend**: GET `/api/{userId}/notes?deleted=true`
- **Features**: Shows restore and permanent delete buttons instead of regular delete

### 3. **Restore from Trash**

- **UI**: Restore button in trash view
- **Backend**: POST `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}/restore`
- **Effect**: Note returns to regular views and disappears from trash

### 4. **Permanent Delete**

- **UI**: Permanent delete button in trash view (red confirmation)
- **Backend**: DELETE `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}/permanent`
- **Effect**: Note is completely removed from system (irreversible)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Frontend (React)

- **File**: `src/components/ImprovedNotesList.jsx`
- **Conditional UI**: Shows different buttons based on `currentView === "trash"`
- **Functions**: `deleteNote()`, `restoreNote()`, `permanentDeleteNote()`

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- **File**: `server/server.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET `/api/{userId}/notes?deleted=true` - List trash
  - PUT `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}` - Soft delete
  - POST `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}/restore` - Restore
  - DELETE `/api/{userId}/notes/{noteId}/permanent` - Permanent delete

### Query Parameters

- **All Notes**: No filters (excludes deleted notes)
- **Trash View**: `?deleted=true` (only deleted notes)
- **Other Views**: Starred, archived, etc. automatically exclude deleted notes
