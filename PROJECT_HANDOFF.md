# Project Handoff - Noet App (Current Stable State)

## Status: READY FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT âœ…

This document provides a complete overview of the current stable state of the Noet note-taking application as of January 2025.

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL: Read These First for Development

**Before starting ANY new development work:**

1. **`COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`** - **MUST READ!** Complete journey of all tag management and font size implementation attempts. Contains:
   - Every approach we tried and why it failed/succeeded
   - Exact problems with font size implementation (and why it was removed)
   - Complete tag filtering solutions that work
   - Debugging techniques that helped
   - What NOT to try again

2. **`TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`** - **Copy-paste ready code!** Contains:
   - Exact working backend tag filtering code
   - Complete frontend UUID filtering implementations  
   - Working font family implementation
   - Color picker component code
   - Directory handling solutions
   - Test code that works

**These documents will save you weeks of rediscovering failed approaches!**

## Quick Start for New Developer

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamGallant/noet.git
   cd noet-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   ./simple-noet.sh
   ```

3. **Test functionality**:
   ```bash
   ./test-runner.sh
   ```

4. **Access app**: http://localhost:3001

## What's Working (Tested & Verified)

### Core Functionality âœ…
- User authentication (demo@example.com / demo123)
- Note creation, editing, and deletion
- Rich text editing with TipTap
- Tag creation and management (UUID tags properly filtered)
- Archive/unarchive functionality
- File uploads and attachments
- Real-time note and tag counts

### UI Features âœ…
- Comprehensive color picker for text formatting
- Font family selection (serif, sans-serif, monospace)
- Improved sidebar with accurate counts
- Archive view toggle
- Note search and filtering
- Responsive design

### Technical Infrastructure âœ…
- Unified directory handling (`simple-config.sh`)
- Proper port configuration (frontend: 3001, backend: 3004)
- Persistent tag storage across server restarts
- Backend API properly filters UUID tags
- Comprehensive test suite
- All scripts work from any directory

## What Was Recently Fixed (Details in COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md)

### Major Fixes (All Tested)
1. **Directory Handling**: Created `simple-config.sh` to eliminate directory confusion
2. **Tag Management**: Fixed UUID tag filtering across frontend and backend
3. **Archive Functionality**: Restored proper archive API calls
4. **Port Configuration**: Standardized frontend (3001) and backend (3004)
5. **Tag Persistence**: Fixed tags persisting across server restarts
6. **UI Stability**: Removed problematic features (font size) for stability

### Known Limitations (Intentionally Removed)
- **Font Size Selection**: Removed due to UI conflicts with TipTap (see COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md for details)
- **Complex Tag Refresh**: Reverted to simple, stable approach

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Port 3001)
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite
- **Editor**: TipTap with custom extensions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Key Files**:
  - `src/App-TipTap.jsx` - Main application
  - `src/TipTapEditor.jsx` - Rich text editor
  - `src/components/NoteEditor.jsx` - Note editing component
  - `src/components/TagManager.jsx` - Tag management
  - `src/components/ComprehensiveColorPicker.jsx` - Color picker

### Backend (Port 3004)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Storage**: File-based JSON
- **Key Files**:
  - `server/server.js` - Main server with all routes
  - API endpoints for notes, tags, users, and files

### Scripts & Configuration
- `simple-config.sh` - Unified directory and environment setup
- `simple-noet.sh` - Simple startup script
- `test-runner.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - VS Code integration

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development
```bash
# 1. Start the application
./simple-noet.sh

# 2. Make your changes in src/ or server/

# 3. Test your changes
./simple-test.sh

# 4. Run comprehensive tests
./test-runner.sh
```

### Key Development Points
- All scripts use `simple-config.sh` for directory handling
- Frontend hot-reloads automatically
- Backend requires restart for changes
- Test suite covers all major functionality

## Important Notes for New Development

### DO NOT BREAK
- The `simple-config.sh` pattern - it solves directory issues
- The UUID tag filtering - it prevents UI corruption
- The port configuration (3001/3004) - it's been tested
- The current tag persistence logic - it works correctly

### SAFE TO EXTEND
- TipTap editor extensions
- New components in `src/components/`
- Additional API endpoints in `server/server.js`
- New test files following existing patterns

### DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES
1. Always run tests before committing
2. Use the existing script patterns
3. Test both frontend and backend changes
4. Update documentation for new features
5. Follow the existing code style
6. **Check COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md before implementing similar features!**
