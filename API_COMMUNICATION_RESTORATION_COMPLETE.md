## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issue: Port Conflict**

The root cause was a **port conflict on port 3004** preventing the backend server from starting properly.

**Symptoms:**

- Backend server showed "Port 3004 is already in use" error
- Frontend could not communicate with backend
- All API calls resulting in connection failures
- Socket hang up errors on file uploads

**Solution:**

```bash
lsof -ti:3004 | xargs kill -9
./simple-noet.sh start-dev
```

### **Secondary Issue: Test Import Path**

Admin interface tests were failing due to incorrect import path in `tests/integration/admin-interface.js`.

**Error:**

```
Cannot find module '/Users/sgallant/sync/rygel/noet-app/tests/integration/src/configService.js'
```

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Changed from:
import configService from "./src/configService.js";

// To:
import configService from "../../src/configService.js";
```

## 🎯 **Remaining Work**

### **Critical Issues: None**

All major functionality has been restored.

### **Minor Issues**

1. **Frontend health check test** - 404 error (likely test configuration)
