# Surgical Rollback Summary

## Date: July 9, 2025

### Issues Addressed

1. **Scrolling Issue**: Middle pane (notes list) was causing whole-screen scrolling instead of independent panel scrolling
2. **React Element Type Error**: "Element type is invalid" error with lucide-react icons in TipTapEditor

### Surgical Rollback Performed

#### 1. Removed Resizable Panel Functionality from App-TipTap.jsx

**What was removed:**

- `sidebarWidth` and `notesListWidth` state variables
- `isResizing` and `resizingPanel` state variables
- `handleMouseDown`, `handleMouseMove`, and `handleMouseUp` event handlers
- Resize handle divs between panels
- Dynamic width styles on panels
- `resizing` class from main container

**What was restored:**

- Fixed-width layout using Tailwind classes:
  - Sidebar: `w-64` (256px)
  - Notes list: `w-96` (384px)
  - Editor: `flex-1` (flexible remaining width)

#### 2. Fixed Vite Dependency Optimization Issues

**For @tiptap/extension-placeholder:**

- Cleared all Vite caches (`node_modules/.vite`, `.vite`)
- Cleared npm cache
- Restarted development servers

**For lucide-react icons:**

- Added `lucide-react` to `optimizeDeps.include` in `vite.config.js`
- Cleared all caches again
- Restarted development servers

### Files Modified

1. **src/App-TipTap.jsx** - Removed resizable functionality
2. **vite.config.js** - Added lucide-react to optimizeDeps

### What Was Preserved

- ✅ AdminInterface component and functionality
- ✅ BulkActionsBar for bulk note operations
- ✅ All Evernote import functionality
- ✅ UserManagement for admin users
- ✅ File viewers (Office, PDF, PowerPoint)
- ✅ Font size fixes
- ✅ All authentication and note management features
- ✅ Tags, notebooks, folders functionality
- ✅ Version history
- ✅ All recent bug fixes and improvements

### Result

- ✅ Independent panel scrolling now works correctly
- ✅ No more whole-screen scrolling when scrolling in notes list
- ✅ TipTap editor loads without React element type errors
- ✅ All toolbar icons render correctly
- ✅ Application is fully functional

### Lessons Learned

1. **Vite Cache Issues**: Vite's dependency optimization cache can cause persistent import errors even after package installation
2. **Surgical Fixes**: Removing only the problematic code while preserving months of other work is the best approach
3. **optimizeDeps Configuration**: Some packages need to be explicitly included in Vite's optimizeDeps for proper pre-bundling

### Commands Used for Cache Clearing

```bash
# Kill existing processes
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
lsof -ti:3004 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf .vite
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm cache clean --force

# Restart
npm start
```
