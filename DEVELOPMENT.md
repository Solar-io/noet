## 🗂 Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure

- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `enhance/*` - UI/UX enhancements

### Commit Strategy
We'll commit incrementally as we add features, with meaningful commit messages:

#### Format: `type(scope): description`
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **enhance**: UI/UX improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Complete Enhanced Editor** (Milestone 1)
2. **Set up feature branches** for parallel development
3. **Implement comprehensive testing** as features stabilize
4. **Create GitHub repository** for remote backup and collaboration
5. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing and deployment

## 🔄 Current Development Focus

**Priority**: Completing the rich text editor features to match the original app's capabilities, then enhancing the organizational and navigation features.

Each feature addition should be:

2. Committed with clear messages
3. Tested for basic functionality
4. Documented in commit descriptions
