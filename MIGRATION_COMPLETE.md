## 🔄 Updated Commands

### New npm scripts:
```bash
npm run test                # Run full test suite
npm run test-status         # Quick health check
npm run test-attachments    # Test attachment functionality

./simple-noet.sh          # Start development (calls scripts/dev/simple-noet.sh)
./test-runner.sh           # Run tests (calls scripts/test/test-runner.sh)
./run-test.sh              # Run specific test (calls scripts/test/run-test.sh)
```
