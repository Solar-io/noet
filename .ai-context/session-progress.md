# NOET APP - Current Session Progress

**Session Date**: July 1, 2025
**Focus**: Soft Delete Implementation + Process Improvement

## üéØ SESSION OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goal
Complete soft delete functionality with incremental, tested changes

### Process Goals
- Implement incremental change strategy (#4)
- Use feature branch workflow (#6)  
- Create test scripts for validation
- Document patterns for future sessions

## üìä SESSION PROGRESS

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Created `.ai-context/project-rules.md`
- [x] Created session progress tracking
- [x] Set up feature branch for soft delete (`fix-soft-delete-ui`)
- [x] Verified soft delete test script exists and is comprehensive

### Phase 3: Soft Delete UI Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] **STEP 1 COMPLETE ‚úÖ**: Fixed delete button in ImprovedNotesList.jsx
  - Changed from hard DELETE to soft delete using PUT with metadata format
  - Updated confirmation message to indicate "move to trash"
  - Added test-ui-soft-delete.js script for verification
  - **CONFIRMED WORKING**: User verified trash icon now works correctly
  - Successfully committed changes
- [x] **PORT MANAGEMENT FIXED ‚úÖ**: Resolved all port conflicts
  - Frontend: Always http://localhost:3001 (strictPort: true)
  - Backend: Always http://localhost:3004 (fail if port in use)
  - Added port-manager.sh script for easy management
- [ ] **STEP 2 NEXT**: Add restore/permanent delete buttons when in trash view
  - Need to detect currentView === "trash" 
  - Replace regular delete button with restore + permanent delete buttons
  - Implement restore API call (PUT with deleted: false)
  - Implement permanent delete API call (DELETE)
- [ ] Run test-soft-delete.js script to validate backend
- [ ] Verify backend filtering logic works correctly
- [ ] Commit working backend state

**Root Cause Found**: Promise in `portManager.isPortAvailable()` never resolved, causing infinite hang

### Phase 3: Frontend UI (Incremental) üîÑ
- [ ] **STARTING NOW**: Read current note list component
- [ ] Step 1: Add trash icon to note list only
- [ ] Step 2: Test trash icon functionality (when backend ready)
- [ ] Step 3: Add restore button to trash view
- [ ] Step 4: Test restore functionality
- [ ] Step 5: Add permanent delete button
- [ ] Step 6: Test permanent delete

**Current Focus**: UI development independent of backend status

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions in file upload
- [ ] Test complete user workflow
- [ ] Final commit and merge

## üß™ TEST SCRIPTS STATUS

### Existing Scripts
- ‚úÖ `test-file-upload.js` - Working, validates file uploads
- ‚ùì `test-soft-delete.js` - Created but needs server restart
- ‚úÖ `test-comprehensive.js` - General functionality

### Needed Scripts
- [ ] `test-ui-interactions.js` - For frontend UI changes
- [ ] `test-trash-workflow.js` - Specific to trash functionality

## üîÑ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Current Task**: Set up feature branch and validate soft delete backend

**Specific Steps**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-soft-delete-ui`
2. Restart server to activate backend changes
3. Run test-soft-delete.js script
4. Document current backend state

**Success Criteria**: 
- Server restart successful
- Backend soft delete endpoints responding
- Test script validates backend logic
- Clean git state for incremental changes

## üìù SESSION NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
- Adopted incremental change strategy
- Focus on ONE feature (soft delete) this session
- Create comprehensive documentation for continuity
- Test after each atomic change

### Patterns Established
- Feature branches for each logical change
- Test scripts before/after each change  
- Documentation-first approach
- Atomic commits with clear messages

### Issues to Watch
- Server restart needed for backend changes
- Filtering logic for trash view (deleted:true)
- State management consistency
- No regressions in working file upload

**Last Updated**: Session start
**Next Update**: After backend validation complete
