# NOET APP - Current Session Progress

**Session Date**: July 1, 2025
**Focus**: Soft Delete Implementation + Process Improvement

## 🎯 SESSION OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goal
Complete soft delete functionality with incremental, tested changes

### Process Goals
- Implement incremental change strategy (#4)
- Use feature branch workflow (#6)  
- Create test scripts for validation
- Document patterns for future sessions

## 📊 SESSION PROGRESS

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Created `.ai-context/project-rules.md`
- [x] Created session progress tracking
- [ ] Set up feature branch for soft delete
- [ ] Create soft delete test script

### Phase 2: Backend Validation
- [ ] Restart server to activate soft delete changes
- [ ] Run test-soft-delete.js script
- [ ] Verify backend filtering logic
- [ ] Commit working backend state

### Phase 3: Frontend UI (Incremental)
- [ ] Step 1: Add trash icon to note list only
- [ ] Step 2: Test trash icon functionality
- [ ] Step 3: Add restore button to trash view
- [ ] Step 4: Test restore functionality  
- [ ] Step 5: Add permanent delete button
- [ ] Step 6: Test permanent delete

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions in file upload
- [ ] Test complete user workflow
- [ ] Final commit and merge

## 🧪 TEST SCRIPTS STATUS

### Existing Scripts
- ✅ `test-file-upload.js` - Working, validates file uploads
- ❓ `test-soft-delete.js` - Created but needs server restart
- ✅ `test-comprehensive.js` - General functionality

### Needed Scripts
- [ ] `test-ui-interactions.js` - For frontend UI changes
- [ ] `test-trash-workflow.js` - Specific to trash functionality

## 🔄 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Current Task**: Set up feature branch and validate soft delete backend

**Specific Steps**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-soft-delete-ui`
2. Restart server to activate backend changes
3. Run test-soft-delete.js script
4. Document current backend state

**Success Criteria**: 
- Server restart successful
- Backend soft delete endpoints responding
- Test script validates backend logic
- Clean git state for incremental changes

## 📝 SESSION NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
- Adopted incremental change strategy
- Focus on ONE feature (soft delete) this session
- Create comprehensive documentation for continuity
- Test after each atomic change

### Patterns Established
- Feature branches for each logical change
- Test scripts before/after each change  
- Documentation-first approach
- Atomic commits with clear messages

### Issues to Watch
- Server restart needed for backend changes
- Filtering logic for trash view (deleted:true)
- State management consistency
- No regressions in working file upload

**Last Updated**: Session start
**Next Update**: After backend validation complete
