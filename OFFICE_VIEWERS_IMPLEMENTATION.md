# Office Viewers Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your original issue was that Microsoft Office file rendering was poor or non-functional:

- **Word documents**: Formatting was inconsistent with Mammoth.js
- **Excel documents**: Basic table rendering only
- **PowerPoint documents**: No support at all (just download button)

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've created a **privacy-focused** Office file viewing system that keeps all your documents secure on your server while providing better rendering capabilities.

## 🏗️ Components Created

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Focus
