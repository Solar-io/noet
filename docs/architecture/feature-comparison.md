## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES**

### 1. **List Functionality Still Broken**

Despite attempts to fix, the list behavior is still not working correctly:

- Enter twice doesn't exit lists
- Backspace doesn't work properly
- List nesting is broken

### 2. **Architecture Mismatch**

- Original uses custom contenteditable with DOM manipulation
- Current uses Slate.js (different paradigm)
- Need to either:
  - Fix Slate.js implementation properly, OR
  - Revert to custom contenteditable approach

### 3. **Missing Core Infrastructure**

- No real user management system
- No proper data models
- No file storage system
- No security framework

2. **Implement proper note management** - Create, edit, delete, organize
3. **Add real data persistence** - Beyond demo data

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality**

1. Proper authentication system
2. Real user accounts and data isolation
3. Full note CRUD operations
4. Basic organization (folders/notebooks)
5. Working rich text editor with lists

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**

1. File uploads and attachments
2. Note versioning
3. Advanced search and filtering
4. User administration

## 📈 **Current Status: 5% Complete**

We have implemented only the most basic skeleton of a note-taking app. The original application is a sophisticated, enterprise-grade system with comprehensive features that would take significant development effort to fully implement.

**Next Steps:**

1. Choose whether to continue with Slate.js or switch to custom contenteditable
2. Fix the fundamental list functionality
3. Implement proper data models and persistence
4. Build core features incrementally
