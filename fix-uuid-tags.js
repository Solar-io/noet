/**
 * UUID Tag Fix Status
 * 
 * This script was created to fix UUID tags in notes, but the solution
 * has been implemented in the backend instead.
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * - Backend now filters out UUID tags when generating dynamic tags
 * - UUID tags in notes are ignored and don't appear in the UI
 * - This prevents the UUID display issue without modifying note files
 * 
 * FILES UPDATED:
 * - server/server.js: Added UUID filtering in the tags endpoint
 * 
 * The backend now:
 * 1. Identifies UUID patterns in note tags
 * 2. Filters them out when generating dynamic tags
 * 3. Prevents them from being counted or displayed
 * 
 * This approach is safer than modifying note files and handles
 * the problem at the source.
