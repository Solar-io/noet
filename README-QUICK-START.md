# Noet App - Quick Start Guide

## Immediate Startup (30 seconds)

1. **Clone and setup** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamGallant/noet.git
   cd noet
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   ./simple-noet.sh
   ```

3. **Access the app**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3004

4. **Login**:
   - Email: `demo@example.com`
   - Password: `demo123`

## That's it! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a fully functional note-taking app with:
- Rich text editing
- Tag management
- File uploads
- Archive functionality
- Color picker
- Font family selection

## Alternative Startup Methods

### VS Code Tasks
1. Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Run "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Start Backend" then "Start Frontend"

### Manual Commands
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
npm run backend

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues
- Frontend should be on port 3001
- Backend should be on port 3004
- If ports are busy, stop other processes or restart

### Directory Issues
- All scripts now use `simple-config.sh` for directory handling
- Scripts work from any directory

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
