# üéØ Feature Development Strategy

## üîÑ The 90/10 Problem - SOLVED

### Old Pattern (90% debugging):

```
Feature Idea ‚Üí Big Changes ‚Üí Everything Breaks ‚Üí Hours of Debugging ‚Üí Frustration
```

### New Pattern (90% features):

```
Feature Idea ‚Üí Sanity Check ‚Üí Small Change ‚Üí Immediate Test ‚Üí Success ‚Üí Next Feature
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention-First Development

### 1. Pre-Development (2 min)

```bash
./dev-check.sh  # Ensures stable starting point
```

### 2. Feature Implementation (Micro-increments)

- **Change ONE thing at a time**
- **Test immediately**
- **Rollback if ANY issue**

### 3. Post-Change Validation (1 min)

```bash
./dev-check.sh  # Ensures still stable
```

## üéÆ Development Workflow Examples

### Example: Adding a new button

```bash
# 1. Sanity check
./dev-check.sh

# 2. Make minimal change (just add button)
# DON'T add functionality yet

# 3. Test in browser
# Does button appear? ‚úÖ

# 4. Add functionality (onClick handler)
# Test again

# 5. Final check
./dev-check.sh
```

### Example: Modifying drag & drop

```bash
# 1. Current state working?
./dev-check.sh

# 2. Change ONE handler at a time
# Test drag & drop after each change

# 3. If anything breaks:
git checkout -- src/components/ImprovedNotesList.jsx
```

## üìä Success Metrics (Track Daily)

| Metric            | Target  | Current |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Features added    | > 1/day | ?       |
| Debug time        | < 30%   | ?       |
| Dev server uptime | > 95%   | ‚úÖ      |
| Successful builds | 100%    | ‚úÖ      |

## üö® Emergency Protocols

### If Dev Server Hangs:

```bash
# 1. Check useEffect dependencies first
grep -n "useEffect" src/components/*.jsx

# 2. Look for missing dependency arrays
# 3. Move functions inside useEffect if needed
```

### If Build Fails:

```bash
# 1. Get detailed error
npm run build

# 2. Fix syntax/import errors
# 3. Test again
```

### If Infinite Renders:

```bash
# 1. Check React DevTools
# 2. Look for state updates in render functions
# 3. Check useEffect dependency arrays
```

## üéØ Next Features (Prioritized)

## Process

1. **You should maintain a feature list and a bug list.**
2. **You should make suggestions for thing that make sense to do at the same time or one after the other**
3. **You should never break the rule of focusing on one thing at a time.** Make suggestions, but remember that stability is more important than going fast.

### High Impact, Low Risk:

1. **Better visual feedback** (drag & drop)
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**
3. **Export functionality**
4. **Bulk operations**
5. **Evernote file import**
6. **Note count on notebooks, but not on folders**
7. **Add an option to adjust font size**
8. **Improve Highlighter colors and selection**
9. **Add ability to change color of tags** 10.**Reimplement note versioning** That includes the ability to quickly select older versions. Highlighting changes and the ability to restore the note.

### Medium Impact:

1. **Advanced search**
2. **Note templates**
3. **Notebook and folder sharing**
4. **Full user administration functions** including user account creation, deletion, bulk note deletion, move note location configuration to only the admin user within the admin console.
5. **Improvements in authentication for users.** They need the ability to change email and password. They need the ability to reset their password via email. We need a fully functional OTP for all users, including admin.

### High Risk (Research first):

1. **Real-time sync**
2. **Plugin system**
3. **Performance optimizations**
4. **Add File handlers for quickview for common file types. Things that are text base, code, scripts, text. Also, pdf, word (if possible), excel (if possible), videos**
5. **Expand the right pane covering the middle and left pane. This would create a larger viewing area for the right pane. I need a way to undo this as well**

## üèÜ Current Achievement: STABLE BASE

‚úÖ **Drag & drop working**  
‚úÖ **Error handling robust**  
‚úÖ **Development environment stable**  
‚úÖ **Prevention tools in place**

**Ready for 90% feature development! üöÄ**
